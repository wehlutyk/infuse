Infuse
======

This project aims to create a pdf-processing Rust → Wasm library, à la [Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid), which can be used to read scientific pdfs as if they were normal web pages.

Current work is going into compiling the C libraries used by Grobid into Wasm. The next step will be to rewrite a large part of the [pdfalto](https://github.com/kermitt2/pdfalto) and Grobid architectures in Rust.
